# Policy And Value Iteration, Reinforcement Learning

# About The Project

The policy and value iteration algorithm has been implemented.


# Getting Started
      
File to run: 
    
    /executor/executor.py
 
 
 `action_set` can be changed in:

      /configs/config.py via the `cfg.action_set` parameter.

policy evaluation implementation:

      /MDP/MDP.py

Visualization for comparing algorithms in terms of speed and convergence is in:

      /plots/


# Additional Information

- Also, when you run `/executor/executor.py`, graphs will be built in the browser, where you can see all the values in more detail.

- In `/plots/`, in addition to graphs, there is a visualization of politics in the form of a matrix and a playing field, and v - in the form of a playing field. In addition to this visualization, they are also output to the console.

- The experiments were run 200 times on small, medium, large and huge sizes and 100 times on colossal size.
after which the time and number of iterations were averaged.
